# JNGL Example Project

Starts a JNGL Game without any logic and just renders a black screen.

## Getting Started

Clone this folder and open it in VS Code. If it's the first time you develop C++/JNGL you have to install the dependencies documented in the JNGL [GitHub Page](https://github.com/jhasse/jngl)
After setting up everything you only have to press F5 and the project will be build and start.

Happy developing!
